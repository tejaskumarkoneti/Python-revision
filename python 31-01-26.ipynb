    "\n",
    "## Aim\n",
    "To develop a simple **Number Guessing Game** that helps beginners understand basic programming concepts such as:\n",
    "- User input  \n",
    "- Conditional statements  \n",
    "- Loops  \n",
    "- The use of the `continue` statement  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Description\n",
    "In this mini project, the computer randomly selects a number within a given range.  \n",
    "The user must guess the number by entering inputs repeatedly until the correct number is guessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the user enters an **invalid input** (for example, a number outside the allowed range), that attempt is skipped and the program continues asking for the next guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the **`continue` statement** is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What the User Needs to Do\n",
    "- The user is asked to guess a number.\n",
    "- If the guess is wrong, the program asks again.\n",
    "- If the guess is outside the allowed range, that attempt is ignored and the game continues.\n",
    "- If the guess is correct, the game ends with a success message.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts Used\n",
    "- User input  \n",
    "- Conditional statements  \n",
    "- Looping  \n",
    "- `continue` statement  \n",
    "- Basic logic building  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Outcome\n",
    "By completing this mini project, students will learn how to:\n",
    "- Control the flow of a loop  \n",
    "- Skip invalid cases using `continue`  \n",
    "- Build simple game logic  \n",
    "- Improve problem-solving skills  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-Life Connection\n",
    "Just like **skipping ads on YouTube and continuing to watch videos**, the program skips invalid guesses and continues the game until the correct number is found.\n"
